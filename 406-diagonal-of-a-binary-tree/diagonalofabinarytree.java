Diagonal sum in a binary tree is the sum of all the node’s data lying through the dashed lines. Given a Binary Tree, print all diagonal sums.

For the above input tree, output should be:

{ 11, 14, 5 }

                1
        /              \
        2              3
    /     \         /    \
  4        5        6     7
          /         \
          1          1
