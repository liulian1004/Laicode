440. Binary Tree Path Sum To Target I
Easy
Given a binary tree and a target sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given target.

Example:
Given the below binary tree and target = 16,

              5
             / \
            4   8
           /   / \
          1    3  4
         /  \      \
        7    2      1
return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path 5-8-3 which sum is 16.
