269. Total Area Of Skyline
Hard
Given n houses on the ground with each house represented by a rectangle. The i-th rectangle is represented as [start_i, end_i, height_i], where  0 <= i < n. The rectangles may overlap with each other.  How can we calculate the total area that these rectangles cover.

Assumptions:

The given array of buildings is not null, the buildings are not null.
Examples:

buildings = {<1,3,1>, <2,4,2>},  output = 5.
