330. One Edit Distance
Medium
Determine if two given Strings are one edit distance.

One edit distance means you can only insert one character/delete one character/replace one character to another character in one of the two given Strings and they will become identical.

Assumptions:

The two given Strings are not null
Examples:

s = "abc", t = "ab" are one edit distance since you can remove the trailing 'c' from s so that s and t are identical

s = "abc", t = "bcd" are not one edit distance
