324. Different Elements In Two Sorted Arrays
Easy
Given two sorted arrays a and b containing only integers, return two list of elements: the elements only in a but not in b, and the elements only in b but not in a.

Do it in one pass.

Assumptions:

The two given arrays are not null.
Examples:

a = {1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5}

b = {2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 6}

The returned two lists are:

[

  [1, 3, 5],

  [2, 4, 6]  // there are two 2s in a, so there is one 2 in b not in a

]
