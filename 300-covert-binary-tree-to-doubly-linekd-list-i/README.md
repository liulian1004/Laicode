300. Convert Binary Tree To Doubly Linked List I
Medium
Given a binary tree, convert it to a doubly linked list in place (use the left pointer as previous, use the right pointer as next).

The values in the nodes of the doubly linked list should follow the in-order traversal sequence of the binary tree.

Examples:

    10

   /  \

  5    15

 /

2

Output:  2 <-> 5 <-> 10 <-> 15
