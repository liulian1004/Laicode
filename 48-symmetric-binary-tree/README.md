Check if a given binary tree is symmetric.

Examples

        5

      /    \

    3        3

  /   \    /   \

1      4  4      1

is symmetric.

        5

      /    \

    3        3

  /   \    /   \

1      4  1      4

is not symmetric.

Corner Cases

What if the binary tree is null? Return true in this case.
How is the binary tree represented?

We use the level order traversal sequence with a special symbol "#" denoting the null node.

For Example:

The sequence [1, 2, 3, #, #, 4] represents the following binary tree:

    1

  /   \

 2     3

      /

    4
