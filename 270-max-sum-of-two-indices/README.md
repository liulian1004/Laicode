270. Max Sum Of Two Indices
Medium
Given an array with integers, find two indices i and j  (j>=i),  such that the value of A[i]+A[j]+ (j - i) is maximized.

Return (i, j).

Assumptions:

The given array is not null and it has length of > 0.
Examples:

array = {1, 5, 3}, the max sum is array[1] + array[1] + (1 - 1) = 10, return {1, 1}
