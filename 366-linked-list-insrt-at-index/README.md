366. Linked List Insert At Index
Easy
Insert a new element at a specific index in the given linked list. The index is 0 based, and if the index is out of the list's scope, you do not need to do anything.

Examples:

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> null, insert 4 at index 3, --> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> null

1 -> 2 -> null, insert 4 at index 0, --> 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> null
