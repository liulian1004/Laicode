204. Maximum Values Of Size K Sliding Windows
Medium
Given an integer array A and a sliding window of size K, find the maximum value of each window as it slides from left to right.

Assumptions

The given array is not null and is not empty

K >= 1, K <= A.length

Examples

A = {1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 1}, K = 3, the windows are {{1,2,3}, {2,3,2}, {3,2,4}, {2,4,2}, {4,2,1}},

and the maximum values of each K-sized sliding window are [3, 3, 4, 4, 4]
