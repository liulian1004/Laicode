257. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree
Medium
Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth. The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Example:
Given the below binary tree

             5

          /       \

        3         8

           \

               4

minimum depth is 2,path is 5â†’8.

Clarification:

  1. The root itself can be a valid path if there is only one node in the binary tree
  2. If root == null, return 0
