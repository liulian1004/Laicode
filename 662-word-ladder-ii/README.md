662. Word Ladder II
Medium
Given a begin word, an end word and a dictionary, find the least number transformations from begin word to end word, and return the transformation sequences. Return empty list if there is no such transformations.

In each transformation, you can only change one letter, and the word should still in the dictionary after each transformation.

Assumptions

1. All words have the same length.

2. All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.

3. There is no duplicates in the word list.

4.The beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.

Example: start = "git", end = "hot", dictionary = {"git","hit","hog","hot","got"}

Output: [["git","hit","hot"], ["git","got","hot"]]
