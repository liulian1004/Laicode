327. Find Local Minimum
Medium
Given an unsorted integer array, return any of the local minimum's index.

An element at index i is defined as local minimum when it is smaller than all its possible two neighbors a[i - 1] and a[i + 1]

(you can think a[-1] = +infinite, and a[a.length] = +infinite)

Assumptions:

The given array is not null or empty.
There are no duplicate elements in the array.
There is always one and only one result for each case.
