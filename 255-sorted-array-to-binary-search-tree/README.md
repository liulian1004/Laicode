255. Sorted Array To Binary Search Tree
Medium
Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.
For testing purpose, please make sure for any node in the result, its left sub-tree should have equal or only one more node than its right sub-tree.

Example:
    Given ascending order array: [1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 11]

    return Binary Search Tree is

              5

          /        \

        3          11

     /     \      /     

   1       4    8
