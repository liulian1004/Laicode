232. Combination Sum
Easy
Given a collection of candidate numbers (C) and a target number (T), find all unique combinations in C where the candidate numbers sums toT. The same repeated number may be chosen from C unlimited number of times.

All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.

Elements in a combination (a1, a2, â€¦ , ak) must be in non-descending order.

The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

Example

          given candidate set 2,3,6,7 and target 7,

    A solution set is:

     [7]

     [2, 2, 3]
