407. Trim Binary Tree by Path Cost
Medium
Given a binary tree, the path cost from the root node to each leaf node is defined to be the number of levels that the leaf is on.

For example, in the following binary tree, the node 5 has its path cost to be 3, and node 8 has its path cost to be 4.

                          1

                      /       \

                   2             3

                /     \             \

             4          5             6

           /   \                      /

         7      8                  9

Given a binary tree, try to delete all the nodes that have no paths whose cost is >= k that go through it. In the above example, node 5 will be deleted  for k = 4.
