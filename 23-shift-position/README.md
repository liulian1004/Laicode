23. Shift Position
Medium
Given an integer array A, A is sorted in ascending order first then shifted by an arbitrary number of positions, For Example, A = {3, 4, 5, 1, 2} (shifted left by 2 positions). Find the index of the smallest number.

Assumptions

There are no duplicate elements in the array
Examples

A = {3, 4, 5, 1, 2}, return 3
A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, return 0
Corner Cases

What if A is null or A is of zero length? We should return -1 in this case.
